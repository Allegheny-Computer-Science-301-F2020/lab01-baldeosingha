### Article 1
 -  Article name.
 - A timeline of Facebook's privacy issues â€” and its responses

-  Reference or article citation.
 - https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/timeline-facebook-s-privacy-issues-its-responses-n859651

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - A synopsis of Facebook's inadequate hadnling of privacy/data

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The ethical concern in my opinion is Facebook's lacidasical attitude towards the privact of their users.
    They were forced to issue and apology to the public for mishandaling their users information after Donald
    Trump's campaign collected data on 50 million people through a through an "innocuous quiz app" .

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The data was described as personal which enlist location, age and interest that you have listed in your FB profile.


- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - My analysis is that companies need to take more resposibility for their user's data from the jump not after the fact when the damage has already been done. Facebook spent millions in penalties to courts and as result hurt themselves too in the long run. Furthermore,their credibility and relationship with users is damaged and the trust of their consumers is broken. The resulting damages reveal that companies need to take more accountability for security and privacy.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - I believe that comapnies that collect data regardless of the platform they offer can gain a warning from this analysis after
 reading about the severe consequences that Facebook has suffered.


### Article 2
 -  Article name.
 - Social media data leak highlights murky world of data scraping

-  Reference or article citation.
 - https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252487895/Social-media-data-leak-highlights-murky-world-of-data-scraping

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - The article descirbes the use of Deep Social's use data scraping by marketing APIs on Tik Tok, Instagram and Youtube's servers.
 They were copying personal information of user's account and selling the data. Furthermore the data was left publicly wide
 open for anyone to acess which rose a growing concern and caused Facebook & Instagram to threaten the data company if they
delete the servers. Social media conglomerates Facebook and Instagram also banned Deep Social from using anymore of their APIs. The breachexposed 235 million user accounts.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - User privacy. All these users could have their profile set to private and think they have the security of showing what they want to only who they specifically want when realtiy anyone can go onto these servers with no password open access and get the information
 for themselves. It violates the agreement between the consumer and the service and creates an unethical way of storing data. Furthermore this data was then sold withouit the user's knowing and makes the ordel far more worse than it already it. In the grand scheme of thing user privacy is the issue but there are multiple facets to that statement that include specifics; such as different
 key values of user object information. People's names, ages, gender, photos and much more were all revealed thus the concern for
 safety and privacy becomes incredibly daunitng.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - It included profile names, real names, profile photos, account descriptions, profile status, follower engagement statistics, and the age and gender of the account holder.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - The APIs provided by Tik Tok, Instagram, and Youtube were not secure and provided third party companies with the abilit to copy data to other servers so that they can monetize it and store the information. As a result these companies had to ban the thrid party repsonsible "Deep Social" and threatent them with legal action to protect their users.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - I think anyone who uses APIs for web scraping could learn about how to use data ethically from companies  that let them acess certain infromation through APIs. APIs are great tools but the can also be abused and they can be taken away if people don't follow
 the guidelines adn regulations set in place to protect users and the orginization.
